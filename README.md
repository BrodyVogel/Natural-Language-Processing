# Natural-Language-Processing
Repo for ANLY 580 (Natural Language Processing Survey)

Homeworks 1 and 2 deal with simple problems from the Natural Language Toolkit textbook, like frequency distributions, tokenizations, etc.

Homework 3 uses the NLTK to guess the language of an input text.

Homework 4 explores Word2Vec.

Homework 5 uses SpaCy and Named-Entity Recognition to summarize articles via simple word clouds.

Homework 6 uses gensim to play around with Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Latent Semantic Indexing.
